# hello-world
my first repository (just a first try..)

Hello, I'm Chloe Gesquiere. I'm in my last year of highschool, in France. My main passions are astronomy, languages and travelling. I would like to learn some more about computer sciences since it's not an option I have chosen in my current studies but that I'm still finding interesting. 
Feel free to share some advices for beginners if you have any! :)
Thank you for your time and reading. Have a good day!
